Text-to-Speech for Visually Impaired Students

Overview

This Python project aims to assist visually impaired students in accessing written content by converting text-based notes into spoken words. It provides a user-friendly interface for faculty members to upload text files containing course materials, which are then read aloud at a customizable speech rate.

Features

File Upload: Faculty members can easily upload text files (e.g., .txt) containing course notes and materials.
Customizable Speech Rate: Users can specify the speech rate (speed of speech) to suit their preferences.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: The program utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text into clear and natural speech.
Accessibility: This tool enhances accessibility for visually impaired students, allowing them to independently access study materials.

Getting Started

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Ensure you have Python installed.
3.Install the required Python library using pip install pyttsx3.
4.Run the program, and follow the on-screen instructions to upload a text file and customize the speech rate.

Usage

1.Faculty members: Upload text files with course materials.
2.Specify the desired speech rate (optional).
3.Sit back and listen as the program reads the notes aloud.
